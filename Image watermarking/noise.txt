Gaussian Noise:

Mean: This parameter represents the average value of the noise distribution. A higher mean indicates larger deviations from the original pixel values.
Standard Deviation: This parameter quantifies the spread of the noise around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates more significant variations in the noise intensity.


Poisson Noise:

Lambda: This parameter represents the average intensity of the noise per pixel. A higher lambda value leads to more frequent and intense noise occurrences.


Salt-and-Pepper Noise:

Density: This parameter represents the proportion of pixels affected by the noise. A higher density results in a more noticeable grainy appearance in the image.
The specific parameters chosen for each type of noise depend on the desired effect and the intended application. For example:

Gaussian noise is often used to simulate sensor noise or thermal noise in images. The mean and standard deviation are adjusted to achieve a realistic noise level.
Poisson noise is suitable for modeling images acquired under low-light conditions or with photon-counting detectors. The lambda parameter determines the granularity of the noise.
Salt-and-pepper noise can represent impulsive noise from faulty sensors or transmission errors. The density controls the amount of noise artifacts in the image.
Understanding the meaning of these parameters and their influence on the noise characteristics is essential for choosing appropriate values and interpreting the results of noise analysis and noise reduction algorithms.
